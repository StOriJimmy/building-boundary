    """
    Trace the boundary of a set of 2D points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : (Mx2) array
        The coordinates of the points
    k : int
        The amount of nearest neighbors used in the concave hull algorithm
    max_error : float
        The maximum average error (distance) the points make with the fitted
        line
    merge_angle : float
        The angle (in radians) difference within two segments will be merged
    num_points : int, optional
        The number of points a segment needs to be supported by to be
        considered a primary orientation. Will be ignored if primary
        orientations are set manually.
    max_intersect_distance : float, optional
        The maximum distance an found intersection can be from the segments.
    alignment : float, optional
        If set segments will be aligned (their intercept be set equal by
        averaging) if the difference between their x-axis intercepts is within
        this number.
    primary_orientations : list of floats, optional
        The desired primary orientations (in radians) of the boundary. If set
        manually here these orientations will not be computed.
    inflate : bool
        If set to true the fit lines will be moved to the furthest outside
        point.

    Returns
    -------
    : (Mx2) array
        The vertices of the computed boundary line
